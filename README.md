Among the tweets 3 topics were found: 
- Official Actions : This topic clearly addresses the conflict through the actions and statements of major international political bodies,
such as the European Union, as well as serveral NGOs like the League of Human Rights.

- The front : Ukraine is portrayed as the theater of the looming war, with military news and facts of the battles on the ground. Subsequently, the direct human and social dimensions of these conflicts emerge in the form of popular support organizing in different regions of the world, such as collections and shipments of essential goods.

- Presidential personalities: This topic represents expressions of the war in Ukraine through a sort of presidential prism. The tweets do not focus on any specific type of events or facts. Instead, they directly discuss the presidents (especially Putin, Macron, and Zelensky), not so much as heads of state, but rather as personalities, sometimes quite strong in presence.
